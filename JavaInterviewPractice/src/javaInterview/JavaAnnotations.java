	//Annotations can be applied to the classes, interfaces, methods and fields.
	//An annotation always starts with the symbol @ followed by the annotation name. The symbol @ 
				//indicates to the compiler that this is an annotation.
	
	//For e.g. @Override
	
	
	//Java has three built-in annotations:
		//@Override
		//@Deprecated
		//@SuppressWarnings ----- using @SuppressWarnings annotation that would suppress that deprecation warning.
	

	//In the custom annotation example we have used these four annotations: 
		//@Documented ------- indicates that elements using this annotation should be documented by JavaDoc
		//@Target------ It specifies where we can use the annotation, can only be used on methods
		//@Inherited ------ annotation signals that a custom annotation used in a class should be inherited by all of its sub classes
		//@Retention ------  annotation indicates how long annotations with the annotated type are to be retained.
